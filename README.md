Cloud9 is a cloud-based dev environment.  You can sign up / sign in with your GitHub account and access a [shared workspace](https://ide.c9.io/stvhwrd/mysql).  The team ([@dylgol](https://github.com/dylgol), [@sterlinglaird](https://github.com/sterlinglaird), [@stvhwrd](https://github.com/stvhwrd)) will always have access to the shared workspace, but you are welcome to clone it, start from scratch, or ignore it completely.

#####Once you've signed up or signed in to Cloud9 (if you decide to do so) I'll be able to share the workspace with you.
